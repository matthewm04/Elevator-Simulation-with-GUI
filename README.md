# Elevator-Simulation-with-GUI
A little simulation of an elevator using object oriented programming principles and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library. And C++.

#######################################################################################

If you want to run this application, just get the ElevatorSimulation.exe file from the Release folder.
You can play around with it and see what it does.

If you want to build it yourself, you will need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed (one of the later versions).

This was a project I made for a class at school

I made it because it was an Object Oriented Programming class and I needed to demonstrate my understanding of OOP

What is does is fairly simple; it simulates an elevator (like you would find in an apartment building). It uses a lot of objects, many functions, inheritance, polymorhism, etc.

Making this project has given me a good understanding of the basics of OOP
  (Going through this project much later I realize I don't remember all the concepts in as much detail as I used to but I am surprised with how well I remember them)

Thanks for taking the time to go through my project!
And feel free to let me know if there are any major issues (be nice please)
