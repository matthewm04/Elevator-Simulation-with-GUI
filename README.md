# Elevator-Simulation-with-GUI
A little simulation of an elevator using object oriented programming principles and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library



This was a project I made for a class at school. I used C++ to write it and the MFC and ther Microsoft Visual Studio tools to make it.

I made it because it was an Object Oriented Programming class and I needed to demonstrate my understanding of OOP

What is does is fairly simple; it simulates an elevator (like you would find in an apartment building). It uses a lot of objects, many functions, inheritance, polymorhism, etc.

Making this project has given me a good understanding of the basics of OOP
  (Going through this project much later I realize I don't remember all the concepts in as much detail as I used to but I am surprised with how well I remember them)

Thanks for taking the time to go through my project!
And feel free to let me know if there are any major issues (be nice please)
